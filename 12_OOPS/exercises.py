# Exercises – OOP

**Easy**
1. Class `Car` with `make`, `model`, `year` and a `description()` method.
2. Class `Circle` with class var `pi` and method `area(r)`.
3. Instantiate two objects and print their distinct `id()`.

**Medium**
4. Inheritance: `Animal` (method `speak`) -> `Dog`, `Cat` overriding `speak`.
5. `Stack` class with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `size`.
6. Encapsulation: `Student` with private `__grade`, getter/setter validating 0-100.

**Hard**
7. Abstract Base Class `Vehicle` with abstract `max_speed`, `fuel_type`.
8. Polymorphic `total_area(shapes)` taking list of Rectangles/Circles.
9. Multiple Inheritance: `Duck` inherits `Flying` and `Swimming`.
10. Singleton Metaclass ensuring only one instance of `Logger`.
