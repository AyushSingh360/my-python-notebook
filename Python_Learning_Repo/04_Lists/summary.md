# Summary – Lists

## Take‑aways
- **Mutable**: Can change in place.
- **Ordered**: Indexing works.
- **Dynamic**: Grow/shrink as needed.

## Syntax recap
```python
L = []
L.append(1)
L[0] = 5
del L[0]
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Recall 0-based indexing.
- [ ] Use `pop()` to remove from end.
- [ ] Use slicing `L[:]` to copy.
