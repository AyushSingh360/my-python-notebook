# Conditional Statements

## 1. Topic definition
Conditional statements allow a program to execute different code paths based on boolean expressions (`if`, `elif`, `else`).

## 2. Why these exist
They enable decision‑making, which is essential for any algorithm that reacts to inputs or states.

## 3. Real‑world usage
- Form validation (e.g., checking password length).
- Feature toggles.
- Implementing business rules (e.g., discounts based on cart value).

## 4. Key rules & syntax
```python
if condition:
    # block
elif other_condition:
    # block
else:
    # block
```
- Indentation (4 spaces) is mandatory.
- Conditions use boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- `elif` allows checking multiple exclusive conditions.
