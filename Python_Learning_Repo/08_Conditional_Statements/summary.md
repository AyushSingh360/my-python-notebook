# Summary – Conditional Statements

## Take‑aways
- `if/elif/else` controls flow based on boolean logic.
- Indentation defines blocks.
- Use `==` for comparison, never `=`.

## Syntax recap
```python
if cond1:
    ...
elif cond2:
    ...
else:
    ...
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify logic with specific test cases.
- [ ] Check indentation.
- [ ] Avoid deeply nested ifs; refactor where possible.
