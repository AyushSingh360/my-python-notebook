# Summary – Data Types & Operators

## Take‑aways
- Choose the appropriate data type for the problem.
- Understand operator precedence.
- Use `is` for identity, `==` for equality.
- Membership tests (`in`) work on sequences and sets.

## Syntax recap
```python
x = 10          # int
s = "text"      # str
lst = [1,2,3]   # list (mutable)
if x > 5 and "a" in s:
    print("Condition met")
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify types with `type()`.
- [ ] Practice arithmetic and logical operators.
- [ ] Use `in`/`not in` for membership checks.
- [ ] Distinguish `==` vs `is`.
