# Summary – Loops

## Take‑aways
- `while` repeats on condition; `for` Iterates over a sequence.
- Be careful of infinite loops.
- `break` exits immediately; `continue` jumps to check/next item.

## Syntax recap
```python
for x in iterable:
    ...
while condition:
    ...
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Ensure loop termination condition is reachable.
- [ ] Use `range()` for counter loops.
- [ ] Avoid modifying a collection while iterating over it.
