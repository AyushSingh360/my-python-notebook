# Introduction to Python

## 1. Topic definition
Python is a high‑level, interpreted programming language designed for readability and rapid development.

## 2. Why Python exists
It abstracts low‑level details (memory management, compilation) so developers can focus on problem solving.

## 3. Real‑world usage
- Web back‑ends (Django, Flask)
- Data analysis (pandas, NumPy)
- Automation scripts
- Teaching programming fundamentals

## 4. Key rules and syntax
- Files end with `.py`
- Indentation (4 spaces) defines blocks
- Statements end with a newline, not a semicolon
- Comments start with `#`

## 5. Step‑by‑step explanation of examples
See **examples.py** – each line is commented to show purpose.
