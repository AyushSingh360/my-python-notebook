# Summary – Introduction

## Take‑aways
- Python is interpreted, uses indentation, and is great for rapid development.
- Core constructs: `print`, variables, basic operators, `if/else`.
- Use `input()` for user interaction and f‑strings for formatting.

## Syntax recap
```python
print("Hello")
name = "Bob"
if condition:
    ...
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Run a simple "Hello, World!" script.
- [ ] Practice variable assignment and basic arithmetic.
- [ ] Write an `if/else` block.
